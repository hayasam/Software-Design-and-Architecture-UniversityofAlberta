#### Code Base
the code base you will be working with is an Android application. Capstone assignments in this course build off the Capstone assignments in the earlier Object-Oriented Design course.

In the application’s current state:

* A user of the app—the owner—is able to record the items they own and wish to share.
* The owner may view: all of their items; their “Available” items; or, their “Borrowed” items.
* The owner can add a contact to their list of contacts.
* The owner may view a list of their contacts.
* The owner may change the status of an item they own from “Available” to “Borrowed” or vice versa.
* When an item’s status is changed to “Borrowed”, the owner must select the borrower from the owner’s list of contacts.
* The owner can edit or delete a contact, but only if the contact is not currently borrowing an item.
